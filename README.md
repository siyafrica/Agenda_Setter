#Agenda Setter

Agenda Setter is a project that was brainstormed by Media Monitoring Africa during our first School of Data workshop that was held in Johannesburg in September 2014. MMA conceived a project that seeks to find the most influential people in terms of news makers and journalists on Twitter in South Africa.

Several journalists and news sources were chosen to examine in terms of their Twitter activity in order to gauge their influence on the social platform.

I used twitteR package on R+RStudio to scrape the Twitter profiles of the news makers and journalists.

In order to register my Twitter app I used the recipe found on this webpage: http://www.datablog.sytpp.net/2014/04/scraping-twitter-with-r-a-how-to/

This repo contains both the R script and the CSV files (for the journalists and sources) containing 200 scraped statues and their metadata.
